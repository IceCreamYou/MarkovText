[Try the demo!](https://icecreamyou.github.io/MarkovText/)

Enter input text and get back output that scrambles the words, but looks
similar to the input. You can try using any writing sample, including your own,
although it needs to be at least 4-5 sentences (and ideally longer) to work
well. If you need inspiration, try samples of books from
[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).

This is mainly for entertainment but can produce some interesting phrases. Here
is an example output sampled from a short story I wrote:

    Tom elbowed him. “fine. But the two of these things is over.” Ellie ran
    forward. Tom and band-aids. Anna picked herself up as a priest! Colin put
    his best horrified face. He couldn’t place where the other than peanut
    butter sandwiches and touched her hard. “why does anyone but couldn’t play
    tag ellie, and thereafter led an eerie quiet contentment when ellie for
    you.” Her eyes widened. “right?” “well i want you got in fact a two-team
    game.” Tom shouted at her. She stopped. Ellie turned away when i have to
    look at her. She slid off the bell rang. Recess was saying. Tom let out
    laughing. “you just so they hit the wizards’ flag will be the flag!” said
    tom.
